# OOP

#### Encapsulation

This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside

#### Polymorphism

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

#### S.O.L.I.D.

* **Single-responsibility Principle:** A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
* **Open-closed Principle:** Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* **Liskov substitution principle:** The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass. [Read More](https://stackify.com/solid-design-liskov-substitution-principle/)
* **Interface segregation principle:**
* **Dependency Inversion principle:**

#### Why Getters and Setters are good?

 Because we can handle the user input by setters and the output by getters. Maybe in the future we need to change the value of the variable before returning it to the user, it would be a nightmare maintenance if we used the property directly all over the code, but with a getter we could do it only in one place.
