# Algorithms



### Bubble Sort

Complexity: O\(n2\)

advantages:

* Simple
* No need extra memory

### Insertion sort

Complexity: O\(n2\)

Advantages: 

* Simple implementation
* Efficient for small data-sets
* It can sort a list as it receives it. It doesn't need to have the entire array

### Selection Sort

complexity: O\(n2\)

Advantages:

* Simple
* Because it's an inplace sorting algorithm it doesn't need extra memory
