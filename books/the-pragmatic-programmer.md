# The Pragmatic Programmer

**Tip 1:** Care about what you're doing

**Tip 2:** Think about what you're doing

**Take responsibility:**  When you _do_ accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake \(as we all do\) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options. 

**Tip 3:** **Provide Options, Don't Make Lame** [**Excuses**](http://programmingexcuses.com/)**:** 

* Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.

* Instead of excuses, provide options.
