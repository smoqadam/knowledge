## The Pragmatic Programmer

### Chapter 1

**Tip 1:** Care about what you're doing

**Tip 2:** Think about what you're doing

**Take responsibility:** When you _do_ accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. When you make a mistake \(as we all do\) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.

**Tip 3:** **Provide Options, Don't Make Lame** [**Excuses**](http://programmingexcuses.com/)**:**

* Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.
* Instead of excuses, provide options.

**Tip 4 Don't Live with Broken Windows**

* One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.
* Don't leave "broken windows" \(bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code\) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.

**Tip 5 Be a Catalyst for Change**

* You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. It's time to bring out the stones\([Stone Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)\). Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say " of course, it would be better if we added....".

**Tip 7 Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

**Tip 8 Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio** 

An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. • Benjamin Franklin

**Building Your Portfolio**

* invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly.
* **Diversify.** The more different things you know, the more valuable you are.
* **Manage risk.** Don't put all your technical eggs in one basket.
* **Buy low, sell high.** Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just  as rewarding. 
* Review and re-balance.
* Learn at least one new language every year.
* Read a technical book each quarter.

**Communicate!**

* A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.
* A large part of our day is spent communicating, so we need to do it well.
